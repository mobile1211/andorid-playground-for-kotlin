# Playground for Kotlin

Simple examples that help you get started with Appwrite + Kotlin (=❤️)

This is Appwrite server side integration with Kotline. For Android integration please look at our [Android playground](https://github.com/appwrite/playground-for-android) and [Android SDK](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-android)

### Work in progress

Appwrite playground is a simple way to explore the Appwrite API and Appwrite Dart SDK. Use the source code of this page to learn how to use different Appwrite Dart SDK features.

## Get Started
This playground doesn't include any dart best practices, but rather intended to show some of the most simple examples and use cases of using the Appwrite API in your dart application.

## System Requirements
* A Linux/Windows/Mac system Intellij Idea
* You have readily available Appwrite running instance (localhost in most cases).
* Create a project in Appwrite instance using console
* Generate a secret key in the Appwrite instance using console

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Open repository in Intellij Idea
3. Open `src/main/kotlin/Main.kt` file
4. Copy the project_id, endpoint, secret key from the Appwrite Console
5. Update project_id, endpoint, secret key by copying from the console in the `src/main/kotlin/Main.kt` file
